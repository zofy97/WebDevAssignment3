Your task in this assignment is to select a company, topic or organisation and to create a website presenting information about it. Each student in the group should be responsible for the creation of three HTML pages (giving a total of either 9 or 12 pages in the site for the website in total).

The members of the group will decide on a topic for the website, and decide on the appropriate subtopics to assign for research by each individual member of the group.

Each individualâ€™s set of webpages should include appropriate tags for formatting, images, tables, lists, forms, etc. Each webpage should contain comments indicating the student responsible for the page.

A common style sheet should be devised and used for all pages on the website. You should also investigate the use of frames/inline frames and of dynamic content using scripts and multimedia elements within your webpages.

Your submission should include:

the set of webpages, with subfolders being used for graphic and other media files, stylesheets and scripts,

a Word document outlining the structure of the website, giving a brief description of the purpose of each page along with the name of its author.


You will present this website as a group in the final class of the semester. All members of the group are expected to contribute to the project and to take part in the final presentation.
