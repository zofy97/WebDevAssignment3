                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Heavy Rain is an interactive drama and action-adventure game developed by Quantic Dream and published by Sony Computer Entertainment as a PlayStation 3 exclusive in February 2010. The game features four protagonists involved with the mystery of the Origami Killer, a serial murderer who uses extended periods of rainfall to drown his victims. The player interacts with the game by performing actions highlighted on screen related to motions on the controller, and in some cases, performing a series of quick time events. The player's decisions and actions during the game affect the narrative; the main characters can be killed, and certain actions may lead to alternative scenes and endings.</p>
                <p>Game developer David Cage wrote a script of 2,000 pages, acted as director for the four years of development, travelled to Philadelphia to research the setting, and intended to improve upon what was flawed in his previous game Fahrenheit. Composer Normand Corbeil wrote the score, which was recorded at Abbey Road Studios. Heavy Rain was a critical and commercial success, winning three BAFTA awards and selling over five million copies. The game received praise for its emotional impact, visuals, writing, controls, voice acting, and music; critics conversely faulted the controls, voice acting, and plot inconsistencies. A PlayStation 4 version was released as a standalone title and in the Quantic Dream Collection with Beyond: Two Souls in 2016.</p>
