                <p>After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own ideas and loyalty to the gang who raised him.Gameplay Red Dead Redemption II is a western action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective, featuring single-player and online multiplayer components.[5] The game has new features absent from the previous game.

Realizing that the progress of civilization is ending the time of outlaws, the gang decides to gain enough money to escape the law and retire. They rob a train owned by Leviticus Cornwall, who responds by hiring Pinkerton Agents led by Andrew Milton to apprehend them. The gang perform numerous jobs and heists, as Dutch continually promises that the next heist will be their last.Following a successful bank heist in Valentine, and a deadly shootout with Cornwall's men, the gang relocate to Lemoyne. They meet the Grays and Braithwaites, two warring families potentially hoarding civil war gold.</p>

They meet the Grays and Braithwaites, two warring families potentially hoarding civil war gold. Dutch pits the families against each other, but his actions are uncovered, resulting in an ambush by the Grays, and the Braithwaites kidnapping John's son, Jack. The gang retaliates against both families, and learns that Jack is with crime lord Angelo Bronte. Bronte returns Jack and embraces the gang, but then lures them into a trap. Dutch seeks vengeance, kidnapping Bronte with the gang and then feeding him to an alligator.</p>
			    <p>	Later, Hosea and an unconfident Dutch lead the gang in a Saint Denis bank robbery. The Pinkertons intervene, killing Hosea and Lenny, and arresting John. Dutch, Arthur, Bill, Javier and Micah escape the city via a ship heading to Cuba. A torrential storm sinks the ship, and the men wash ashore the isle of Guarma, where they become embroiled in a war between the tyrannical sugar plantation owners and the enslaved local population. The group successfully aids the revolution against the plantation owners, and secures transport back to the United States.</p>
