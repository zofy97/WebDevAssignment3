                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Like in other games in the series, in Mario Kart 8, players control characters from the Mario franchise and participate in kart racing on various race tracks, using a variety of items to hinder opponents or gain advantages in the race. While incorporating game mechanics originally featured in earlier Mario Kart games, Mario Kart 8 introduces anti-gravity sections that allow players to drive on walls or ceilings, in addition to allowing them to bump into one another for a short boost. The game features single-player and multiplayer gamemodes, including online via the Nintendo Network.</p>
               <p>Mario Kart 8 was a critical and commercial success upon its release, and is the best-selling Wii U game, with over eight million copies sold worldwide. The game continued to receive post-release patches and downloadable content, including additional characters, vehicles and tracks, and support for Nintendo's Amiibo line of figurines. An enhanced port for the Nintendo Switch, titled Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, was released worldwide in April 2017. It was both a critical and commercial success, selling over eleven million copies worldwide by September 2018, ranking it among the system's best-selling games.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the game's launch in the United Kingdom, it was announced that week-on-week Wii U console sales had risen 662% in the country, with Mario Kart 8 bundles accounting for 82% of the units sold.In its first four days on sale, it became the fastest selling Wii U game to date, with over 1.2 million copies sold worldwide. Within a month of the game's release, it had increased to 2.82 million.By the end of 2017, the game had sold over 8.42 million copies worldwide, making it the best selling Wii U game by then.</p>
