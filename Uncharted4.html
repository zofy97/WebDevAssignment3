                <h3>Description</h3>
								                <p>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is an action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 4 in May 2016. Following Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, it is the final Uncharted game to feature protagonist Nathan Drake (portrayed by Nolan North). Drake, retired from fortune hunting with his wife Elena, reunites with his estranged older brother Sam and longtime partner Sully to search for Captain Henry Avery's lost treasure.</p>

									<p>The game features larger and more open levels than previous Uncharted games; players have more freedom to explore and move in combat, progress through enemy encounters undetected using stealth, and can use vehicles. Sony revealed Uncharted 4 at the North America PlayStation 4 launch event in November 2013. Development was hampered by extensive script changes and reshoots following the departures of lead Uncharted writer and creative director Amy Hennig and director Justin Richmond in March 2014. Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, who had directed Naughty Dog's previous game, The Last of Us, became the directors.</p>

								<p>	Reviewers found Uncharted 4 a worthy conclusion to Nathan Drake's arc, with praise directed at its narrative, emotional depth, visual quality, multiplayer mode, improved gameplay, and music. It was the best-reviewed game of 2016, receiving numerous year-end accolades, including various Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications and award events. The game sold over 2.7 million copies in its first week of release, becoming the fastest-selling entry in the series and the best-selling PlayStation 4 game. A standalone expansion, The Lost Legacy, was released in 2017.</p>

								<p>Years before the events of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, brothers Nate and Sam Drake hunt for the treasure of infamous pirate Henry Avery, who plundered $400 million during the 1695 Gunsway heist. Alongside their financier Rafe Adler, the Drakes infiltrate a Panamanian jail to access the former cell of Avery's first mate, where Nate discovers a hollow St. Dismas idol. Rafe impulsively murders the prison warden Vargas, triggering a frantic escape which sees Sam shot by guards and Nate fleeing, believing his brother to be dead.

								Fifteen years later, Nate has retired with his wife Elena, but misses the excitement of his old life. He is visited by Sam, who survived his injuries and has spent the intervening time incarcerated. He escaped with drug lord Hector Alcazar, who, entranced by Sam's Avery tales, has demanded that Sam find the treasure or be killed. Although reluctant to return to adventuring, Nate agrees to help Sam, but tells Elena he has accepted a salvaging job.</p>
