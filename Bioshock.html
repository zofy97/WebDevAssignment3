                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>BioShock is a first-person shooter video game series developed by Irrational Games—the first under the name 2K Boston/2K Australia—and designed by Ken Levine. The series is considered a spiritual successor to the System Shock series, on which many of Irrational's team including Levine had worked previously. Additionally, the series is notable for exploring philosophical concepts.</p>
                <p>The first game in the series was released for the Windows operating system and Xbox 360 video game console on August 21, 2007 in North America, and on August 24 in Europe and Australia. A PlayStation 3 version of the game, which was developed by 2K Marin, was released internationally on October 17, 2008 and in North America on October 21, 2008 with some additional features.[4] The game was also released for the Mac OS X operating system on October 7, 2009. A version of the game for mobile platforms has also been developed by IG Fun. A sequel, BioShock 2, was released on February 9, 2010. On August 12, 2010, Irrational Games unveiled a trailer for a new game titled BioShock Infinite, released on March 26, 2013. With the release of BioShock Infinite selling over 11 million copies as of May 2015, the three games combined have more than 25 million copies sold.</p>
                <p>A fourth game to the series is in reported development, under the working name Parkside.</p>
